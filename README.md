# 🚀 DSA Journey in C++

Hi there! 👋 This is my personal repository where I’m solving LeetCode and GFG problems in **C++** to strengthen my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills.

## 🎯 Goal

- Solve **500+ DSA problems**
- Cover all major DSA topics
- Write clean, efficient, and well-explained code
- Be consistent and improve problem-solving skills

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Each folder is categorized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, DP).
Every problem includes:
- `problem.cpp`: Code with comments
- `problem.md`: Explanation (Intuition, Approach, Time/Space Complexity)

---

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- ✅ Arrays
- ✅ Strings
- ✅ Linked Lists
